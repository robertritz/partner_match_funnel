# Partner Match Funnel - How many people meet your partner criteria where you live?
There are many fish in the sea right? Well if you have too many criteria for your match, you are probably excluding a large number of those fish. Or maybe there are more fish than you expect!

Use this app to discover how many people match your criteria where you live. Data is available for the **100 metro areas with the largest populations** in the United States.

Data was collected from the [US Census American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.html). This app originally appeared on [datafantic](https://datafantic.com/are-you-being-too-picky-in-a-partner)
